# Mushrooms
CPSC 437 Final Project for Victor Del Carpio and Samuel Tigistu. A simple mycology Flask application that allows users ready access to mycological information.
Users will be able to search for mycological species/genus. These queries will result in providing
users with images, and information about the mycological organism of interest.
